# Logistics Optimization & Demand Forecasting 📦

This project was conducted during my **internship at LOGISALL**. The goal was to optimize logistics center locations and forecast demand using **machine learning and data analysis techniques** to reduce transportation costs, improve efficiency, and predict future demand for effective inventory management.

**Note:** The data used in this project is **internal company data**, so it cannot be uploaded here. The report is originally in **Korean**, and I will try to upload the **translated version** as soon as possible.

# Logistics Optimization & Demand Forecasting ðŸ“¦

This project was conducted during my **internship at LOGISALL**. The goal was to optimize logistics center locations and forecast demand using **machine learning and data analysis techniques** to reduce transportation costs, improve efficiency, and predict future demand for effective inventory management.

**Note**: The data used in this project is internal company data, so only a limited amount of data could be uploaded here. 
The report is originally in Korean, and I will try to upload the translated version as soon as possible.

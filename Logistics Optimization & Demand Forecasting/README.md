# Logistics Optimization & Demand Forecasting ðŸ“¦

This project was conducted during my internship at LOGISALL in Seoul. The goal was to optimize logistics center locations and forecast demand using machine learning and data analysis techniques to reduce transportation costs, improve efficiency, and predict future demand for effective inventory management.

**Note**: The data used in this project is internal company data, so only a limited amount of data could be uploaded here. The report is originally in Korean, and I will try to upload the translated version as soon as possible. Additionally, as the data comes from a Korean company, the column names in the dataset are in Korean as well.

# Data Science Portfolio  

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. I am a data science major with experience in machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization. This repository showcases projects from my undergraduate studies and internships, covering a range of topics, including:  

- **Predictive Modeling** – Regression, classification, and time series forecasting  
- **Optimization & Algorithms** – Game theory applications, decision models, and efficiency analysis  
- **Big Data & Cloud Computing** – Handling large datasets and utilizing cloud-based solutions
- **Data Visualization** – Interactive dashboards, visual analytics, and D3.js-based visualizations

Each project includes a brief overview, dataset source (if applicable), and key insights. Feel free to explore the repositories, and do not hesitate to reach out for discussions or collaborations.

# Data Science Portfolio

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄAbout Me

Hello! I'm Yunseo ‚Äî a data science graduate with a liberal arts background from Yale-NUS College.  
I‚Äôm passionate about using data to make better decisions in uncertain situations, and I enjoy translating complexity into clear, actionable insights.

Having grown up in Korea and studied in Singapore, I bring both adaptability and a global mindset to my work.  
This portfolio highlights some of the projects where I‚Äôve used data to solve real problems ‚Äî hope you find something that resonates!

## Core Projects

- ### Logistics Optimization & Demand Forecasting üì¶ 
  - Conducted during an internship at LOGISALL (Seoul), this project optimized warehouse locations by clustering 32,000+ GPS data    points, achieving ~15% projected reduction in transportation costs.  
  - Developed short-term demand forecasting models using Prophet & ARIMA that improved prediction accuracy by ~20%, enabling more    effective inventory management.

- ### MLB Player Salary Prediction ‚öæ 
  - Predicted MLB player salaries using Ridge and Lasso regression on performance metrics from Fangraphs and Statcast, explaining    ~18.5% variance for batters and ~36.7% for pitchers.  
  - Included log transformation to address heteroscedasticity and enforced MLB minimum salary rules for realistic projections.

- ### Sportipy ‚Äì Running Performance Analysis üèÉ
  - Processed running datasets from Runtastic and TicExercise to analyze workout patterns through data cleaning, visualization,      and clustering of GPS coordinates.  
  - Built Python functions to visualize distance trends, speed distributions, run start times, and created heatmaps of running       itineraries.

## Additional Projects

- **SQL-SMILES-Database-Management-System**  
  - Designed and implemented a relational database schema in MySQL Workbench, including indexing, constraints, complex queries,     and automated data loading with Python.

- **Google-Scholar-Scraper**  
  - Developed a Python package to scrape, store, and analyze author & publication data from Google Scholar, featuring database caching, H-Index computation, and citation graph visualization.

- **Alcohol-Consumption-Viz**  
  - Built an interactive D3.js dashboard to explore global alcohol consumption, with choropleth maps, bar charts, and scatter plots examining geographic patterns, health impacts, and population effects.
